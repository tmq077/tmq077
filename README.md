[`A self-help tool for couples to understand their attachment style`](https://github.com/tmq077/GA_Project_3)
<br>To help couples facing difficulties in their relationship strengthen communication through recognizing and understanding their attachment styles, this project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, as well as classifier models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, to learn from data scraped from two subreddits: Anxious Attachment and Avoidant Attachment. 
<br>A self-help tool is developed using Logistic Regression with Count Vectorizer, with an accuracy of 90%, allowing users to easily identify attachment style of both themselves and their partner's, and gain insights to improve their communication through the relevant resources.
