[`A self-help tool for couples to understand their attachment style`](https://github.com/tmq077/GA_Project_3)
To help couples facing difficulties in their relationship strengthen communication through recognizing and understanding their attachment styles, this project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies such as Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer, as well as classifier models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, to learn from data scraped from two subreddits: Anxious Attachment and Avoidant Attachment. 
<br>A self-help tool is developed using Count Vectorizer and Logistic Regression, with an accuracy of 90%, allowing users to easily identify attachment style of both themselves and their partner's, and gain insights to improve their communication through the relevant resources.
