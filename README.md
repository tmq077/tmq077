# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Below are a list of data science projects I have completed. Click on the project title to find out more! 

[`"DonateFoodGoWhere" - Chatbot for donating specific food items in Singapore`](https://github.com/tmq077/GA_Capstone_Project)
<br>â€¢	One of Singaporeâ€™s food waste management strategies is encouraging the public to donate excess food. And organizations that accept food donations have specific wish list and donation requirements.
<br>â€¢	This project aims to streamline the process for individuals to find the right organizations for their specific food item donations, by building a custom chatbot using ChatGPTâ€™s large language model, fine-tuning, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
<br>â€¢	A custom chatbot is developed using GPT-Turbo-3.5 and RAG, with answer relevancy of 0.97 and faithfulness of 0.87 (the closer the value is to 1, the better the model), where users can easily find out where and how to donate specific food items with just one to two questions.

[`A self-help tool for couples to understand their attachment style`](https://github.com/tmq077/GA_Project_3)
<br>â€¢	Communication breakdown is one common reason for divorce. 
<br>â€¢	This project aims to help couples strengthen communication through recognizing and understanding their attachment styles, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, as well as classifier models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to learn from data web scraped from two subreddits - Anxious Attachment and Avoidant Attachment.
<br>â€¢	A self-help tool is developed using Logistic Regression with 90% accuracy, allowing users to quickly identify both theirs and their partnerâ€™s attachment style by answering four questions, and gain insights to improve communication through the recommended resources.

[`Analysis and Prediction of HDB Resale Flat Price`]
<br>â€¢	Affordable public housing has become a concern to new homeowners with rising resale flat prices. 
<br>â€¢	This project aims to help homebuyers plan their finances through predicting resale flat prices, by identifying factors out of 76 features affecting prices using exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis, and regression models with regularization techniques. 
<br>â€¢	A HDB resale price calculator is developed using Linear Regression with 9 features, achieving R2 of 0.89 (the closer to 1, the better the performance), allowing potential homebuyers to easily predict the price of their desired resale flat.
