## Below are a list of data science projects I have completed. Click on the project title to find out more! 

[`"DonateFoodGoWhere" - Chatbot for donating specific food items in Singapore`](https://github.com/tmq077/GA_Capstone_Project)
•	One of Singapore’s food waste management strategies is encouraging the public to donate excess food. And organizations that accept food donations have specific wish list and donation requirements. 
•	This project aims to streamline the process for individuals to find the right organizations for their specific food item donations, by building a custom chatbot using ChatGPT’s large language model, fine-tuning, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
•	A custom chatbot is developed using GPT-Turbo-3.5 and RAG, with answer relevancy of 0.97 and faithfulness of 0.87 (the closer the value is to 1, the better the model), where users can easily find out where and how to donate specific food items with just one to two questions.

[`A self-help tool for couples to understand their attachment style`](https://github.com/tmq077/GA_Project_3)
•	Communication breakdown is one common reason for divorce. 
•	This project aims to help couples strengthen communication through recognizing and understanding their attachment styles, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, as well as classifier models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to learn from data web scraped from two subreddits - Anxious Attachment and Avoidant Attachment.
•	A self-help tool is developed using Logistic Regression with 90% accuracy, allowing users to quickly identify both theirs and their partner’s attachment style by answering four questions, and gain insights to improve communication through the recommended resources.
